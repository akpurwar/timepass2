      "description": "<div>On a bright sunny morning a group of kids in the neighbourhood found an open field inviting for a game of football.&nbsp; However, there was an issue—they didn’t have a football kit.&nbsp; So, the kids decided that each one of them would bring one item to build the kit.&nbsp; One brought the football, another got the corner flag, and the remaining brought goalkeeper gloves, marking chalk, goalposts, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Everyone gathered on the ground as it was now time to make two teams.&nbsp; But soon, an argument broke out due to lack of consensus on who gets to pick the teams.&nbsp; The kids then determined that the person who had brought the most important item to play, will get to decide the teams.</div><div><br></div><div>Time passed by and they were still unable to decide the most important thing.&nbsp; Finally, they concluded that they would just start playing with all the items that were brought and then get rid of items one at a time to see which is the most important item left in the end to play the game.</div><div><br></div><div>And so, the game started.&nbsp; The first thing they got rid of was the whistle because they felt the referee could shout instead of whistling.&nbsp; Then, the goalkeeper removed his gloves and started saving the ball without them.&nbsp; Moving forward, they replaced the goalpost with a couple of bins on each side.&nbsp; Eventually, they replaced the football with an old tin and continued to play.&nbsp; Then after some time, with no proper kit or team formation, they got tired of playing a listless game and it was called off.</div><div><br></div><div>Often, in today’s world, we become so competitive that our aspiration to be a leader compromises our ability to even be a good team member!&nbsp; Our competitiveness, without collaborative spirit, is counterproductive.&nbsp; Sure, we may succeed to a degree without team effort.&nbsp; But the degree of that success is equivalent to winning a football game being played with tin-cans!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Team initiatives, on the other hand, help us win games that are of consequence!</div>",

That can’t happen to Brazil! Such fictitious odds don’t exist in the betting world.&nbsp; The Germans are great, but surely not 7-fold greater!&nbsp; The outcome was uncanny.&nbsp; &nbsp;Something terrible had happened.&nbsp; There has to be some serious business learning here…</div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, this turned out to be one of the simplest business case studies to crack.&nbsp; Brazil played without its two leaders – their main striker Neymar (because of injury) and their captain Thiego (because of yellow-card breaches).&nbsp; The exclusion of their key leaders is the only tangible difference and logical explanation that one can conjure to explain the fiasco.&nbsp; The headless team was completely demoralized, it was no longer a well-knit unit that could regroup and rally back after early setbacks in the game.&nbsp; A perfect illustration of how things can go wrong when you don’t have strong leadership and a well-knit team.</div><div><br></div>",

Perhaps, these indulgences explain my lethargy in getting back to productive activities like “blogging”. Of course, whether “blogging” falls in the productive category is an altogether different subject. But from web community’s perspective, the blogger does owe his loyal followers a continuous churn of content! Or does he? Does ‘loyalty’ deserve special privileges across all walks of professional life?

He had kind of gatecrashed into our campus recruitment being held at CDAC’s Pune campus. You see, Vishal didn’t belong to the passing out batch. He was a CDAC alumni who had not managed to land up with a job in spite of the booming IT job market! His financial position was very fragile, which explained why the CDAC coordinator intervened to allow him to appear for campus interviews. Two minutes with Vishal and it was clear why he was still jobless. He was too much of a simpleton, so much so that he wouldn’t speak at all —in any language! My dad prompted me to extend Vishal an offer… purely out of humanitarian consideration. And Vishal joined Cybage— two weeks prior to the other three employees; you see, someone had to help with cable, computer, furniture setup, etc.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\">Very quickly, Vishal became a key back-end programmer of Cyberage raider. His mild and cooperative demeanor made him reasonably popular amongst his teammates. Then when Cybage forayed into services business, there was a quick exodus of the original team to the land of opportunity. That is, everyone except Vishal! His personality made it difficult for him to get an overseas break. So he stayed a while longer and helped stabilize the first few contracts of Cybage before, eventually, his much awaited break to migrate to USA came through. Over the next few years, Vishal stayed in constant touch, a more confident professional who hadn’t forgotten his roots, his heartfelt gratitude and unflinching loyalty towards Cybage stayed intact!</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\">Then, one day, he decided to migrate back to India. Cybage, of course, welcomed him back with open arms. The most ‘original’ loyalist coming back—what more could Cybage ask for?

Vishal’s performance was just not up to the mark. He still worked very hard and was fully committed, but not to the organization’s satisfaction vis-à-vis his peers. Pretty soon it became obvious—Vishal had not changed, but Cybage had moved on! With our growing brand and deeper pockets, we had managed to rope in brighter professionals than the original Cybage team, so the clear distinction stood out. We tried two project changes with Vishal, but the stark contrast persisted. As time rolled by, Vishal found himself at the receiving end of our appraisal system’s fairness prompting him to eventually bid adieu to Cybage—this time for good! Sad ending; Cybage did not even attempt to hold back one of its original crusaders!</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\"><em>So how much importance does the word “loyalty” holds for an organization?

So, if the raw ingredients that make up loyalty are already weaved into every organization’s appraisal DNA, what is the need to duplicate them by adding redundant parameters like “years of tenure” in the measurement environment?

In a clinical sense, loyalty implies refined qualities such as a finer degree of “Commitment”, “Attitude” and “Org Alignment”. These qualities are parameters that are used to gauge a professional in every organization. No different than other key parameters such as “IQ”, “Technical”, “Communication”, and so on. So, if the raw ingredients that make up loyalty are already weaved into every organization’s appraisal DNA, what is the need to duplicate them by adding redundant parameters like “years of tenure” in the measurement environment? After all, isn’t over-bias towards ‘loyalty’ the same as relative penalizing of a ‘newcomer’ in the organization? Clearly, “a blind loyalty towards loyalty” can spell doom for an organization in the long run.</em></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\"><em>However when it comes to matters of heart, “turning a blind eye towards loyalty” has equally disastrous implications—for loyalists are the organization’s cultural touch bearers, and any cultural dilution is the beginning of any company’s collapse! The matter is further complicated by the current demand-supply mismatch in our industry where the clearly drawn battlefield sees equally formidable armies on both sides—loyalists versus job-hoppers! Both battalions have pros and cons in their arsenal. With Lord Krishna off on a timeless sabbatical, which side should the confused ARjUN pick?</em></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\"><em>“Pro” debate: What is more advantageous: Org alignment of a loyalist, or industry exposure of a job hopper?</em></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\"><em>“Con” debate: Which vice is worse: Complacency of a loyalist, or opportunism of a job hopper?</em></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.65; text-align: justify; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, fontawesome; font-size: 14px;\"><em>Perhaps the good old-fashioned opinion/comment poll by the learned audience can help arJun arrive at that elusive balance point?</em></p>",
